# imok

This program was designed for those who live alone.
It is a fail safe alarm that will alert friends or family, vial email, if the IMOK button is not pushed before a specific planned interval. Eg: daily.
It would be great for people that have pets and worry what would happen to them if they passed away or were incapacitated.

As it is web page based, any device can be used. Smart phone, PC, etc.

It was designed to be a fail safe. If it was designed as a stand alone app on a phone (no server, no web page), and your battery dies, no message would be sent. By having to report to a server, the server can send out the alert if you do not report in.

Program is subject to change and no assumption of reliability can be assumed.
This is a proof of concept script. Don't risk your life on it.

It also comes with a simple PERL Module, AuthorizeMe, that takes care of the account registration, password managemet, tokens, etc.
It also has methods you can use to easily save and retrieve database information (hash, array or scalars) to a text flat file.
