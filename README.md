# imok

This program was designed for those who live alone.
It is a fail safe alarm that will alert friends or family, vial email, if the IMOK button is not pushed before a specific planned interval. Eg: daily.

It was designed to be a fail safe. If it was designed as a stand alone app on a phone (no server), and your battery dies, no message would be sent. By having to report to a server, the server can send out the alert if you do not report in.


Program is subject to change and no assumption of reliability can be assumed.
This is a proof of concept script. Don't risk your life on it.
