About:</br>
IMOK is a web based, fail safe, alarm that will email your family and friends if you don't check in.</br>
</br>
Help:</br>
-Some options are accessed from the hamburger icon.</br>
-After registering for an account, click on 'Settings'.</br>
-Select a 'Check In Start Date' and a 'Check In Start Time' that you will be able to 'Check In' by.</br>
-Select a 'Check In Interval'. Daily seems reasonable.</br>
-Add up to three email addresses to send alerts to. You must enter at least one.</br>
-Modify the default alert message to suit your situation. Add contact numbers, instructions, etc...</br>
-If you push the IMOK button before the 'Check In Time' no alert will be sent to your email list, and a new 'Check In Time' is set to the next 'Check In Interval'.</br>
-If you do not push the IMOK button before the 'Check In Time', an alert email will be sent to your email list every half hour until you push the IMOK button.</br>
-If you push the IMNOTOK button an email alert is sent immediately to those in your email list.</br>
</br>
Example: If you choose a 'Check In Start Date' of 10 Sept 2021 and a 'Check In Start Time' of 9 am and a 'Check In Interval' of one day, every time you push the IMOK button your  'Check In Time' will be reset to 9 am the next day.</br>
