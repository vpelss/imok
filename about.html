IMOK is a web based, fail safe, alarm that will email your family and friends if you don't check in.

Potential uses:

- For those living alone and do not have regular personal contact.
- For those who have animals or pets that may suffer or die if they pass away or became incapacitated.
- For those who live in a remote location.
- For those taking a trip alone.
- For those planning on getting kidnapped

## HELP

- Some options are accessed from the menu icon in the upper left corner.
- After registering for an account, click on 'Settings'.
- Add up to three email addresses to send alerts to. You must enter at least one.
- Modify the default alert message to suit your situation. Add contact numbers, instructions, etc...
- Select an 'Alert Date' and an 'Alert Time' that you will be able to 'Check In' by.
- Select an 'Alert Interval'. Daily seems reasonable.
- click 'Save' on the settings page.

- If you push the IMOK button before the 'Alert Date/Time' no alert will be sent to your email list, and a new 'Alert Date/Time' is set to the next 'Alert Interval'.
- If you do not push the IMOK button before the 'Alert Time', an alert email will be sent to your email list every half hour until you push the IMOK button.
- If you push the IMNOTOK button an email alert is sent immediately to those in your email list.

Example: If you choose an 'Alert Date' of 10 Sept 2021 and an 'Alert Time' of 9 am and an 'Alert Interval' of one day, every time you push the IMOK button your next 'Alert Date/Time' will be reset to 9 am the next day.
